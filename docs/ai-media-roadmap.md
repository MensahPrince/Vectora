# AI media tools roadmap — M9

The CapCut AI features people use daily — captions, transcript editing,
silence removal, text-to-speech, background removal — local-first and
provider-abstracted. This is the feature-area plan for `v1-roadmap.md` § M9.

Policy reminder: **AI is a first-class, provider-abstracted feature.** Local
inference is the default where it's feasible; every capability also has a
provider seam so cloud models plug in later (M9's last phase) without touching
the feature code. **AI proposes, the engine disposes**: every media-tool edit
lowers to ordinary `cutlass_commands`, applied through normal dispatch, grouped
per action, and undoable like any gesture.

## Dependency reality (why the order below)

M9's v1-roadmap entry depends on M3 (agent + providers), M6 (matte plumbing),
M7 (caption track), and M8 (beat markers). As of `alpha-0.4.0`:

- **M3 ✅** — the agent, providers, wire/validate/eval harness all shipped.
- **M8 ✅** — the audio suite shipped; its pure-DSP-in-`cutlass-decoder`
  pattern (beat detection, ducking, denoise) is what the energy-based tools
  here reuse directly.
- **M6 ❌ not started** — no mask/matte input in the compositor yet, so
  **background removal** (which feeds an alpha matte into the M6 pipeline) is
  *gated* and lands after M6.
- **M7 ❌ not started** — no styled caption track to render cues into, so
  **auto captions** are *gated* and land after M7.

So the order is **unblocked-first**: silence removal (no model, no gated dep)
ships first, then the model-backed transcribe foundation and the features that
ride it, and the two gated features land when their substrate (M6/M7) exists.

## Architecture invariants (apply to every phase)

- **Provider-abstracted, local-first, never local-only.** `cutlass-ml`
  defines the inference traits (`Transcribe`, `Matte`, `Tts`, …); local
  runtimes (whisper.cpp, ONNX Runtime, a Piper/Kokoro-class TTS) land first,
  cloud adapters are additive. No feature hard-codes a runtime.
- **Models are data, downloaded on demand.** Model files live in
  `~/.cutlass/models/` (the config-dir convention `recent.json` / `autosave/`
  / `config.toml` established), fetched on first use with a checksum, never
  bundled into the binary or a project file.
- **AI proposes, the engine disposes.** Analysis produces a *proposed* edit
  (a cut list, a set of cues, a generated audio clip); applying it is ordinary
  commands in one history group with `rollback_group` on failure. The dry-run
  preview from M3 (the action list before applying) is reused as the review
  surface for destructive tools like AutoCut.
- **Pure DSP / inference stays model-free and off the UI thread.** The
  sample-domain analysis (silence, energy) takes `&[f32]` and returns plain
  `Vec`s with no media/model/timeline types — the M8 seam (`detect_beats`,
  `speech_band_energy`) — so the tricky parts unit-test on synthetic input.
  The engine owns decode and timeline mapping; inference runs on a worker.
- **The vocabulary grows by the M3 checklist.** Every agent-exposed tool is a
  wire DTO + validation + action-log phrasing + a versioned schema-snapshot
  bump + a stub-provider eval. No tool joins the vocabulary by accident.

## Phase 1 — Silence removal / AutoCut (unblocked, model-free)

Energy-based silence detection → a proposed cut list → reviewed in the M3
dry-run preview → applied as one undoable history group of ripple deletes.
Needs no model and no gated dependency: it's pure DSP in `cutlass-decoder`
(next to beat detection / ducking, the M8 precedent — **not** `cutlass-ml`,
which is for model-backed inference) plus the existing ripple commands.

- [ ] **Silence DSP** (`cutlass-decoder/src/audio/silence.rs`):
      `detect_silences(mono, sample_rate, &SilenceSettings) -> Vec<(f64, f64)>`
      returns silent spans in seconds. A control-rate (≈100 Hz, the ducking
      hop) broadband RMS envelope marks hops below `threshold`; contiguous
      below-threshold runs longer than `min_silence` become spans, each shrunk
      inward by `keep_padding` so word onsets/offsets aren't clipped. Pure,
      unit-tested on synthetic tone-burst / silence signals.
- [ ] **Cut planner** (engine, pure): silence spans (decoded per media clip,
      mapped seconds → timeline ticks through the clip's live window and
      speed) → a list of timeline ranges to ripple-delete on the clip's track,
      merging spans that abut across the clip boundary, clamping to the
      selection, and dropping spans that would leave a sub-frame remainder.
      Linked A/V ripple together so pairs stay aligned. Unit-tested as a pure
      planner (no decode).
- [ ] **`RemoveSilences` command + engine action**: decode the target clips,
      run the planner, and apply the cut ranges as split + ripple-delete on the
      magnet track in one `CompoundAction` (one undo restores every clip and
      shift). Rejected on generated clips and media without audio. Mirrors the
      `DuckLanes` "analysis writes ordinary edits" shape.
- [ ] **Agent tool**: `remove_silences` (clip ids + optional `threshold` /
      `min_silence` / `padding`) lowers to `RemoveSilences` — "cut the silences
      out of the interview" from a prompt. Wire DTO + validation + action-log
      phrasing + schema snapshot bump + eval.
- [ ] **UI**: an "AutoCut / Remove silences" control in the clip audio
      inspector that runs the analysis and shows the proposed cuts in the M3
      dry-run action list; one click applies them as a single history group.
      Threshold / min-pause / padding controls with broadcast-sane defaults.

## Phase 2 — `cutlass-ml` crate + transcribe foundation

- [ ] **`cutlass-ml` crate scaffold**: workspace member, off the default build
      like a future `cutlass-py`; inference traits (`Transcribe` first) with a
      local whisper.cpp-backed implementation and a model-download/cache helper
      (`~/.cutlass/models/`, checksummed). Provider seam for cloud transcribe.
- [ ] **Word-level transcription**: audio lane → segments + word timestamps,
      the substrate both captions (Phase 4) and transcript editing (Phase 3)
      consume. Off-thread, progress-reported through the established handle
      pattern.

## Phase 3 — Transcript-based editing (flagship) — needs Phase 2

- [ ] **Transcript panel**: words mapped to source time from whisper stamps;
      selecting/deleting words emits ordinary ripple-cut commands on the
      underlying clips (one undoable history group), so editing the text edits
      the video. This + the M3 agent is the "AI-first" identity shipped.

## Phase 4 — Auto captions — **gated on M7 (caption track)**

- [ ] Transcribe audio lanes → styled cues on the M7 caption track; word-level
      timing; edit text in the inspector; caption style presets. Translation
      rides cloud providers later. *Blocked until M7 lands the styled subtitle
      lane to render cues into.*

## Phase 5 — Text-to-speech — needs a `cutlass-ml` TTS runtime

- [ ] A text/script → voiceover audio clip path: a local TTS runtime behind
      the `Tts` trait, the generated audio added as an ordinary audio clip;
      provider seam for premium cloud voices.

## Phase 6 — Background removal — **gated on M6 (matte plumbing)**

- [ ] Video matting (RVM/MODNet-class ONNX, via `cutlass-ml`) → an alpha matte
      stream feeding the M6 matte input; cached per clip like proxies;
      fast/quality model toggle. *Blocked until M6 lands the matte/mask input
      in the compositor.*

## Phase 7 — Agent superpowers

- [ ] The agent gains tools over all of the above — "caption this and cut the
      silences", "cut on the beats" — each just commands + the analysis tools,
      no new safety surface beyond the M3 checklist per tool.

## Phase 8 — Cloud provider expansion

- [ ] Anthropic/Gemini-native adapters, a provider-picker UI, and per-feature
      provider routing (e.g. local whisper + cloud LLM). Config-only for users.

## Exit

Import an interview → auto captions → delete filler words in the transcript →
TTS an intro line → "make the music duck under speech" — all local, all
undoable. (Captions and background removal land with M7 and M6 respectively;
silence removal, transcript editing, and TTS do not wait on them.)
