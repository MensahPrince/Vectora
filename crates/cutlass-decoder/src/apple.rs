//! Apple backend: `AVAssetReader` (demux + VideoToolbox decode) behind
//! [`cutlass_core::VideoDecoder`].
//!
//! `AVAssetReader` reads decoded `CVPixelBuffer`s forward from a configurable
//! start time. The output settings list every format we can ingest, so
//! VideoToolbox vends frames in its native decoded format (NV12 video/full
//! range, or 10-bit/`BGRA` for some sources); the exact format is detected per
//! frame from the pixel buffer. Sample data is *not* copied out of the decoder
//! (`alwaysCopiesSampleData = NO`): the CPU path copies planes itself and the
//! GPU path hands the renderer the decoder's own IOSurface, retained.
//!
//! ## Seeking
//!
//! Playback and forward scrubbing never re-seek: [`VideoDecoder::frame_at`]
//! rolls forward from the last emitted frame when the target is just ahead
//! (see [`crate::seek`]), which is what avoids the O(GOP²) re-decode of a
//! seek-per-frame loop. A true [`AvfDecoder::seek`] (backward, or a long jump)
//! tears down and rebuilds the reader at the new start time against the
//! already-parsed `AVURLAsset` — `AVAssetReader` is forward-only, so this is
//! the correct random-access primitive. (`resetForReadingTimeRanges:` was
//! evaluated and rejected: it only re-arms after the *current* range is fully
//! drained, so a scrub seek would decode-and-drop the rest of the in-flight
//! range first, costing more than the reader rebuild it saves.)
//!
//! One caveat other backends don't share: `AVAssetReader` trims its output to
//! the time range, decoding the GOP prefix *internally*, so
//! [`VideoDecoder::frame_at_nearest`]'s "seek + one decode" here returns the
//! frame at/after the target at the cost of the full prefix decode — there is
//! no cheap snap-to-sync-frame on this backend. On long-GOP 4K that is
//! hundreds of milliseconds per cold target (thumbnails, filmstrips); if that
//! ever matters it needs demux/decode split apart (compressed sample output +
//! our own `VTDecompressionSession`), not tuning here.
//!
//! Two pieces of lifecycle hygiene keep sustained scrubbing stable: an
//! outgoing reader is [`AVAssetReader::cancelReading`]-ed when replaced or
//! dropped (releasing a started reader without cancelling leaves its decode
//! pipeline — VideoToolbox session plus queued IOSurfaces — to wind down
//! asynchronously; under scrub churn hundreds of those pile up and exhaust
//! process-wide decode resources, after which *every* decoder in the process
//! fails with "Cannot Decode"), and each frame pull runs inside an
//! [`autoreleasepool`] because decode workers are plain Rust threads with no
//! enclosing pool — without one, AVFoundation's autoreleased bookkeeping
//! accumulates for the life of the thread.
//!
//! ## Open-GOP sources: seek-point decode recovery
//!
//! `AVAssetReader` starts decode at the container sync sample at/before the
//! time range's start and trusts it blindly. Open-GOP H.264 (x264
//! `open_gop=1`, some hardware encoders) marks **non-IDR I-frames** as sync
//! samples, and most of those are followed in decode order by leading
//! B-frames that display *before* the I-frame and reference the **previous**
//! GOP. Starting decode there, VideoToolbox hits references that don't exist
//! and — unlike FFmpeg, which drops the undecodable leading frames — fails
//! the entire reader session (`AVErrorDecodeFailed`, "Cannot Decode") before
//! vending a single frame. On a real-world 4K export with ~10 s GOPs this
//! made *every seek into 8 of the file's 11 GOPs* a hard error, while
//! sequential decode of the same file was flawless (the references exist by
//! the time the boundary is crossed in order).
//!
//! The recovery ([`AvfDecoder::recover_read_failure`]): when the reader
//! fails, rebuild it with the start pulled back from where the caller was —
//! just past the last emitted frame, or the requested seek start — doubling
//! the back-off (1 s, 2 s, 4 s, … clamped to 0, where the first sample must
//! be genuinely decodable) until decode sticks, then walk forward and trim
//! back up to that position. The failure can strike *at* the seek point
//! (start sync sample has leading B-frames; the reader dies before vending
//! anything) or *mid-walk* while crossing such a sync sample after a start
//! at an earlier non-IDR one — resuming past the last emitted frame handles
//! both. Failed attempts are cheap (VideoToolbox dies within a few frames of
//! a bad start, and pre-bound frames skip conversion); the successful
//! attempt pays one GOP-prefix walk, which is what a closed-GOP file would
//! have charged for the seek anyway. If even the start of the stream won't
//! decode (real corruption), the error surfaces — but through
//! [`AvfDecoder::reset_failed_reader`], which replaces the dead reader (a
//! `Failed` reader can never vend again) and clears the roll-forward anchor,
//! so the next `frame_at` re-seeks on a healthy reader instead of re-reading
//! the corpse forever.
