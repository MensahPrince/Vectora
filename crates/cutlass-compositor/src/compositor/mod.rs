//! The composite pass: scene description in, RGBA canvas out.
//!
//! [`Compositor::render`] clears the canvas to the config background, then draws
//! each layer's placed quad bottom-to-top and reads the result back to an
//! [`RgbaImage`]. Three layer kinds share one placement model and target:
//!
//! - **video frames** — uploaded as planes and converted YUV→RGB on the GPU
//!   using the frame's own [`cutlass_core::ColorSpace`]; straight-alpha src-over.
//! - **RGBA bitmaps** — pre-rasterized generators (text/shapes/stickers) or
//!   stills; premultiplied on upload and composited premultiplied src-over so
//!   anti-aliased edges stay clean.
//! - **solid fills** — a fast no-texture path; straight-alpha src-over.
