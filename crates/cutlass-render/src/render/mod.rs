//! The GPU renderer: realize a [`Scene`] into a composited [`RgbaImage`].
//!
//! [`Renderer`] owns the expensive, reusable pieces — a `wgpu` device, the
//! compositor pipelines, a text rasterizer, and a per-media decoder cache — so
//! a single instance renders many frames (preview scrub, export) without
//! re-initializing the GPU or re-opening decoders.
