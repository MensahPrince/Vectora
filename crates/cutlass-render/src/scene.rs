//! The intermediate scene description a render pass consumes.
//!
//! [`resolve`](crate::resolve) turns a [`Project`](cutlass_models::Project) at a
//! timeline instant into a [`Scene`]: the canvas plus an ordered, bottom-to-top
//! stack of placed layers. A `Scene` is a pure value — it names *what* to draw
//! (which media frame, which text, which fill) and *where*, but holds no decoded
//! pixels and touches no GPU. That split keeps the geometry (canvas sizing,
//! z-order, transforms, crop) deterministic and unit-testable without a device,
//! while [`Renderer`](crate::Renderer) does the decode + rasterize + composite.
