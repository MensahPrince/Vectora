//! Transitions (v1 roadmap M4): a timed blend at the junction between two
//! abutting clips on a track.
//!
//! A [`Transition`] is **data**, like effects: the model stores
//! `{left, right, transition_id, duration}` and the compositor owns the WGSL
//! that blends the two frames by progress. The [`transition_catalog`] is the
//! validation + UI source of truth (ids, display names); it is drift-checked
//! against the compositor's renderable set from `cutlass-engine`.
//!
//! A transition lives only while its pair of clips still abuts (left's end
//! tick equals right's start tick). Structural edits that break the abutment
//! prune the dead junction; undo restores it.
