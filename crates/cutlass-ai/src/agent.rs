//! The agent loop: prompt in, validated-and-applied command group out,
//! every step observable.
//!
//! The loop's whole world is the [`EngineBridge`] — it cannot name a file
//! path, a socket, or a UI type. One prompt = one history group: the
//! bridge's group markers wrap the run, failed individual commands are
//! reported back to the model (which may correct course), and the group
//! rolls back only when the prompt aborts (cancellation, provider error,
//! cap exceeded). In dry-run mode nothing is applied; the validated plan
//! comes back for the UI's preview card.
//!
//! Beyond edits, the embedder can wire a [`ToolHost`] of app tools, while
//! the bridge can expose strictly read-only senses of its exact project
//! state. The latter is what lets a model inspect edits inside rehearsal
//! without accidentally looking at the untouched live project. Both are
//! dispatched by exact name and charged against the host-call cap. The
//! built-in `commit_progress` tool records phase breaks so a long task's
//! live replay can land as several undo steps
//! ([`PromptOutcome::phase_breaks`]).

         Rules:\n\
         - All times are in seconds; they snap to whole frames at the \
         project frame rate.\n\
         - Ids (clips, tracks, media) are integers from the project state \
         below. Never guess an id; call describe_project if unsure.\n\
         - trim_clip sets a clip's new timeline start and duration. To cut \
         the FIRST N seconds of a clip, INCREASE start by N and DECREASE \
         duration by N (the source advances automatically). To cut the \
         last N seconds, keep start and decrease duration.\n\
         - Tracks stack bottom-to-top; later (higher) tracks composite on \
         top. Media clips need video/audio tracks; titles need a text \
         track; solids and shapes need a sticker track. Lanes keep fixed \
         zones: audio at the bottom, then the main video track (marked \
         \"main\" in the state; it is permanent and cannot be removed), \
         overlay lanes above it, text lanes on top. Put primary footage \
         on the main track and prefer reusing existing lanes over adding \
         new ones.\n\
         - If a tool call is rejected, read the error and correct course; \
         do not repeat the identical call.\n\
         - The state below is a fresh snapshot of the project as it is \
         now: it already reflects every edit applied so far, including \
         ones made earlier in this conversation. Trust it over anything \
         said earlier; use the conversation only to understand what the \
         user is referring to.\n\
         - describe_project returns this same state, kept current as you \
         edit. When the user only asks a question, answer directly from \
         the state below — do not call describe_project first. But once \
         you have applied edits that move, resize, split, add, or remove \
         clips this turn, call describe_project to read the new positions \
         and ids before any further edit that depends on them: recompute, \
         do not assume, and do not give up. Name clips and tracks by id \
         and content so answers stay checkable; if the state cannot \
         answer a question, say what is missing instead of guessing.\n\
         - Clips on one track can never overlap, and a clip can only grow \
         into free space. To lengthen a clip or insert into a packed \
         track, first make room: move or shift the later clips on that \
         track to the right (shift_clips, move_clip, or ripple_insert), \
         then resize. If a tool call is rejected for an overlap or for \
         exceeding the source media, read the error, re-inspect the \
         current state, and adjust the plan — never abandon the task for \
         lack of state you can fetch.\n\
