//! Validation + lowering: wire commands → engine commands, against a live
//! project snapshot.
//!
//! This is the guardrail chokepoint. Every rejection carries a
//! model-readable message (including the ids that *do* exist) so the agent
//! loop can feed it straight back as a tool result and let the model correct
//! course. Checks here are for good error messages and the whitelist; the
//! engine remains the authority (overlaps, source bounds, rate math) and
//! re-validates everything on apply.
